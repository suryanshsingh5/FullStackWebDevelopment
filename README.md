# 🚀 Full Stack Web Development Mastery – 2026

A focused and disciplined journey toward **full stack web development mastery** in 2026.  
This repository documents my learning path, practice projects, and progress — from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

The goal is **consistency over hype**, **skills over shortcuts**, and **real understanding over tutorials-only learning**.



## 🎯 Objective

Build a **strong full stack foundation** by mastering core web technologies and problem-solving skills, then applying them through hands-on projects.
